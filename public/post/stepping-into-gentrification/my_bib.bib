	abstract = {An understanding of perceived barriers to health-care is critical to improving healthcare access for all Americans. To determine perceived barriers to health-care in an urban poor population in Dayton, Ohio, a face-to-face door-to-door survey of individuals identified through targeted, stratified, area probability sampling was done. A sample of 413 non-elderly poor adults, including 19\% without telephones, reported personal relevance of various barriers to healthcare access. Most frequently endorsed barriers were lack of information about free or reduced-cost health-care, anticipated cost, and difficulty accessing child-care. Seventy-four per cent of respondents reported more than one barrier. Individuals without telephones and those without health insurance reported more barriers to health-care. Reported barriers were similar for working and non-working poor, except for transportation problems, more frequently reported by non-working respondents. This study provides important data on what poor people in a medically underserved community perceive to be barriers to accessing health-care and underscores the importance of including people without telephones in the study design. Respondents who did not have telephones were more likely to report multiple barriers, particularly problems with lack of information about free or discounted medical care, child-care, and transportation. These findings suggest the importance of door-to-door surveys rather than telephone surveys for getting accurate data on the poor.},

	abstract = {The earnings of young adults who live in the same neighborhoods as their parents recover faster after a job displacement than those who live farther away. The earnings of these workers recover in around six years while workers living farther away suﬀer permanent declines. Workers with children of their own drive these divergent earnings outcomes. Diﬀerent job search durations, diﬀerences in mobility after job displacements, housing transfers, and ex-ante diﬀerences between workers are unlikely explanations. Parental employment networks could contribute to our ﬁndings, though we ﬁnd little evidence that adult children ﬁnd work in their parents’ industries.},

	abstract = {A number of recent studies by sociologists have sought to discover whether a person’s status (typically their social class, education, or socio-economic status) is directly affected by the status of their grandparents, once the effects of parents’ status are controlled. The results have been ambiguous, with some studies ﬁnding a direct effect of grandparents on their grandchildren, while others ﬁnd no effect. I use causal graphical methods to demonstrate some of the methodological problems that occur in trying to identify this direct effect, and I offer some suggestions as to how they might be addressed.},

	title = {The {Social} {Construction} of a {Gentrifying} {Neighborhood}},
	abstract = {This study draws upon cognitive maps and interviews with 56 residents living in a gentrifying area to examine how residents socially construct neighborhoods. Most minority respondents, regardless of socioeconomic status and years of residency, defined their neighborhood as a large and inclusive spatial area, using a single name and conventional boundaries, invoking the area’s Black cultural history, and often directly responding to the alternative way residents defined their neighborhoods. Both longterm and newer White respondents defined their neighborhood as smaller spatial areas and used a variety of names and unconventional boundaries that excluded areas that they perceived to have lower socioeconomic status and more crime. The large and inclusive socially constructed neighborhood was eventually displaced. These findings shed light on how the internal narratives of neighborhood identity and boundaries are meaningfully tied to a broader structure of inequality and shape how neighborhood identities and boundaries change or remain.},

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This website is devoted to exploring public policy and its implications in the North Carolina Piedmont Triad. Primary focus will be on the cities of Greensboro and Winston-Salem. The aim is to provide &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; analysis of policy through quantitative methods and discussing the potential impacts of ongoing projects. By offering fair and balanced analysis, the hope is that the people who live in the effected communities can be better informed and can communicate with policymakers for future benefit, while understanding the trade-offs of each policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exploring policy implications at the local level using quantitative approaches, we can better seek to understand the implications within our community. We can use some of the most advanced tools available in statistics, economics, and political science and apply them within our community. In fact, the local community is the best place to apply these methods in order to quantify potential impacts and assess policies.&lt;/p&gt;

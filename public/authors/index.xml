      <description>&lt;p&gt;This website is devoted to exploring the policy implications in the North Carolina Piedmont Triad. Primary focus will be on the cities of Greensboro and Winston-Salem. The hope is that by exploring policy implications at the local level using quantitative approaches, we can better seek to understand the implications within our community. We can use some of the most advanced tools available in statistics, economics, and political science and apply them within our community.&lt;/p&gt;
